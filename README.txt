Implementation of a functional operating system kernel that supports time
sharing threads for the RISC-V processor architecture. 
    The kernel is implemented in C/C++ language using assembler for the target processor. 
Memory allocator and thread management were implemented within this project. The kernel 
provides threading, semaphore and time-sharing support, as well as asynchronous context 
switching and preemption on interrupt from timer and keyboard.
